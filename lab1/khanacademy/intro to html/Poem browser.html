        Stayin' Alive
     </h1>
<p>     
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother<br>
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive<br>
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'<br>
And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive<br>
Ah, ah, ah, ah<br>
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive<br>
Ah, ah, ah, ah<br>
Stayin' alive<br>
Oh, when you walk<br></p>
